# ECE Maker Hub

Hi! I'm a final-year Electronics & Communication Engineering student passionate about IoT, drones, and embedded systems.

This repo is my personal lab — where I build, learn, and share smart projects using ESP32, Arduino, and sensors.

## Projects Highlights
- *Smart Door Lock* – RFID & relay-based access system  
- *Gas Leak Detector* – MQ-4 + Buzzer + Blynk alerts  
- *MoodBot13* – OLED face robot with emotions  
- *Drone Flight Core* – Pixhawk 2.4.8-based flight controller

## Tech Stack
ESP32 • Arduino • Sensors • Blynk • IoT • C/C++ • Embedded Logic
